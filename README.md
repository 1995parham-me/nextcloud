# nextcloud

## Introduction

I want to try out nextcloud on very limited embedded server using its All-in-One docker.
The fist time initiation, you need to go for `https://ip-address:1378` to do the first-time only configuration.
The all-in-one container uses the docker socket to deploy other services in docker.

The service is deployed behind [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/).
